# SVM Classifier from Scratch: Binary Classification with Gradient Descent

## Overview

This project is a hands-on implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier designed to solve binary classification problems. The classifier is built from scratch using Python, and the training process is optimized using batch gradient descent. This project is aimed at providing a deep understanding of the SVM algorithm and its training process.

## Features

- **Manual SVM Implementation**: The SVM classifier is implemented without the use of high-level libraries, providing insight into the underlying mechanics of the algorithm.
- **Batch Gradient Descent**: The classifier uses batch gradient descent to optimize the model parameters, minimizing a loss function that includes a regularization term.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The learning rate (`alpha`) and regularization parameter (`lambda`) are customizable, allowing for experimentation and optimization.
- **Binary Classification**: The SVM is designed for binary classification tasks, effectively separating data into two classes.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: The project includes unit tests that validate the correctness of the implementation at various stages of training and prediction.
